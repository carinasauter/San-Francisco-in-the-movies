# movies-shot-in-SF
A spatial data analysis on movie shot locations in San Francisco

Users can provide a location name (eg. address like '1500 Van Ness Avenue' or sight name like 'City Hall') and a radius in meters. The program then returns a visualization of the location in Google Maps plus the locations where movies were shot.
